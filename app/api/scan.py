class UserSpaceScanner(ABC):
    """
    the API for scanning a user space for application-specific purposes.

    From the perspective of this scanner, the user space is characterized by an identifier
    and two locally mounted filesystem directories: the "user" directory where
    the user has uploaded files, and the "system" directory where this scanner can
    read and write files not visible to the end-user.  When a scan is initiated, an
    implementation of this class is instantiated with these characteristics as properties,
    and then its :py:meth:`fast_scan` and :py:meth:`slow_scan` functions are called in that
    order.  Passed into these functions are the file-manager's metadata for the files (which
    can include subdirectories) that should be scanned.  Note that the slow_scan is called
    asynchronously (i.e. via the ``async`` keyword); however, :py:meth:`fast_scan` is
    guaranteed to be called before :py:meth:`slow_scan` is queued for the same set of files.

    The scanning functions are passed a dictionary of metadata that describe the files
    that should be scanned.  The top-level properties capture information about the set of
    files as a whole; the expected properties in this dictionary are as follows:

    ``space_id``
        str -- the identifier for the space
    ``scan_time``
        float -- the epoch time that the scan the produced this file listing was started.
    ``scan_datetime``
        str -- an ISO-formatted string form of the ``scan_time`` value (for display purposes)
    ``fm_space_path``
        str -- the file path of the user space from the file-manager perspective.  This is the
        path that a user would see as the location within the file-manager (nextcloud)
        application for the user's upload directory.
    ``contents``
        list -- an array of objects in which each object describes a file or subfolder within
        the user space.  (See file metadata properties below.)
    ``last_modified``
        str -- a formatted string marking the last time any file was modified in this record space.
    ``is_complete``
        bool -- True, if the contents represents a complete listing of all files and folders
        within the space.  If False, it is expected that the scannning functions will be called
        additional times with different sets of contents until the entire contents have been
        examined.

    The metadata may include additional top-level properties.  For example, it may include
    nextcloud properties describing the top level folder that is represents the user space.

    Each object in the ``contents`` list is a dictionary that describes a file or folder.  The
    following properties can be expected:

    ``fileid``
        str -- an identifier assigned by nextcloud for the file being described.
    ``path``
        str -- the path to the file or folder being described.  [This path will be the full
        path to the file and will start with the value of ``fm_space_path`` (defined above).]
    ``resource_type``
        str -- the type of this resource.  Allowed values are: "file", "collection"
    ``last_modified``
        str -- the formatted date-time marking the time the file was last modified
    ``size``
        int -- the size of the file in bytes
    ``scan_errors``
        list[str] -- a list of messages describing errors that occurred while scanning this file.

    Additional properties may be included.  For example, the file metadata may include nextcloud
    file properties for the file.

    The scanning functions can update any of this metadata in their returned version which will be
    made accessible to the client.

    See also the :py:class:`UserSpaceScannerBase` which can serve as a partially-implemented
    base class for a full implementation.
